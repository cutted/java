### Module Overview
The first part of this module builds on students' existing programming skills by covering concepts and techniques relevant to the construction of complex interactive software applications, including object-oriented polymorphism, exception handling, event-driven programming and user interface development. 
The second part explores programming language design and implementation concepts including language evaluation, syntax specification, compilation, control structures, memory allocation and abstraction mechanisms. The learning outcomes aim at achieving the graduate hallmark of having a critical and reflective knowledge and understanding of the subject, thinking independently, analytically and creatively, and being able to synthesise new and existing knowledge to generate ideas and develop creative solutions.
### Learning Outcomes
- Design, implement and test programs making use of appropriate use of inheritance, polymorphism and exception handling.
- Construct interactive software applications with usable user interfaces.
- Explain the components of different programming languages and critically compare their design.
- Define formally the syntax of language constructs and describe the operation of the phases of program compilation.
